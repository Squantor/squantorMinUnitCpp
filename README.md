# Minimal unittest for C++
This project contains a minimal unittest framework for C++ that looks a lot like the standard MinUnit that is often used in C, but usable for C++.
## Checking out
use ```git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Squantor/squantorMinUnitCpp.git``` to clone the repository and its submodules.
## Compiling
This project uses gnu make as its build system on a Linux platform. There are two build targets: release and debug. Release builds with optimizations and minimal debugging information. Debug builds with no optimization and full debug information.
```
$ make debug
$ make release
```
